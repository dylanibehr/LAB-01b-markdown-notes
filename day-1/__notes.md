Here is some test notes for day 1

I am going to explore some ways change different markup features

## This makes things larger

# This is even larger

**This makes things bold which is cool**

*This makes things italic*

> block quote wooo!

1. This is a nice way to take notes
2. Why did I not think of this when I was an undergraduate
3. Maybe in the future I will take notes in Markdown

- It is also possible to take notes in bullet form
- Which is nice for general lists
